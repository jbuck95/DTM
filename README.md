# WIP-Work in Progress.

This Plugin lets you convert your .docx files into .md with two easy Commands. You need Pandoc installed for it to work properly:

I know there are alternatives (for example Docxer: https://github.com/Developer-Mike/obsidian-docxer)  but the other Plugins had no working footnotes for .latex Templates, which is what I need.
Media extraction is halfway there cause im not converting to html and then to md, but simply useing Pandoc to convert directly from docx to md. This sometimes results in  pictures missing. I need it for text, footnotes etc.


1) **Install** 
2) check the settings tab, define your media folder. 

3) 2 Commands: 
    - "DTM: Convert Docx to md"
    - "DTM: Clean .md" (not finished) -> will delete auto gen content of pictures and converts the broken links to markdown links, so the pictures that do get extractet will get displayed in the md.
